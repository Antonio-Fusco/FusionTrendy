# FusionTrendy
FusionTrendy was the final project of a 3-months course as Java Developer at Generation Italy. 
My team and I played the role of implementing a CMS (Content Management System) for a clothing business which deals with creating, updating 
and removing products, categories and discount strategies.

My tasks involved:
- refactoring DAO classes
- managing login / sign up both back-end and front-end sides
